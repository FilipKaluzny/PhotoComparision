The main idea behind this app is to use keypoints and their descriptions:

2.		https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d2/d29/classcv_1_1KeyPoint.html

You detect keypoints using ORB algorithm and use them to rotate pictures and find differences between them.

Bellow are other links to the materials i used in this program:

3.		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-KWKPk9Zc

Unfortunetely i don't have most of them, pay attention to DigitalSreeni channel, it's quite good.
