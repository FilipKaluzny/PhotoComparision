The main idea behind this app is to use keypoints and their descriptions to compare two images that can be sligtly rotated. 
You can select photos to compere from file explorer ( buttons "Photo no.1" and "Photo no.1") or use GoPro Camera to send photos directely to app (credits to https://github.com/KonradIT/goprowifihack).

Differences beetween images are marked with blue circles drawed on one of them, also thresholded image is printed on the left panel, areas that differs will be marked black, while identical regions stays white. In addition structural similarity index is printed (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity), the closer to 1.0, the more identical pictures are.
